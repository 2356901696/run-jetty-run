  * For Jetty8 's restriction , you have to use a "JDK Runtime" instead of default JRE Runtime to run it, or the JSP complier will not work.

  * Currently we do not support the Servlet3 annotations in Jetty8 ,    we will try to handle this in 1.3.1 soon.

And thanks James Synge , Eelco Hillenius for building a such good project and invited me to join the project.
