You could change the port , context-path, web-app directory in the run configuration.

  * Now default disable after 1.3.3 , you could enable it manually in the run configuration.

Since JNDI is not a common case for J2EE development  ,

You could enable the "JNDI support" in "Advanced options" of Run Configuraiton.
